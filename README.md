###  Text Analytics

<i>Text Analytics</i> , also known as <i> text mining</i> is the methodology and process followed to derive quality and actionable information and insights from textual data. This involves using NLP, information retrieval, and machine learning techniques to parse unstructured text data into more structured text data into more structured forms and deriving patterns and insights from this data that would be more useful for end user. Text analytics comprises a collection of machine learning, linguistic, and statistical techniques that are used to model and extract information from text primarily for analysis needs, including business intelligence, explorattory, descriptive and predictive analysis.

Some of the main techniques and operations in text analytics:
- Text Classification
- Text Clustering
- Text Summarization
- Sentiment Analysis
- Entity extraction and recognition
- Similarity analysis and relation modeling

Doing text analysis is sometimes a more involved process than statistical analysis or machine learning. Before applying any learning technique or algorithm, we have to convert the unstructured data into a format acceptable by those algorithms.
